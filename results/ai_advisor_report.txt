## CUDA Shader Benchmark Analysis

⚠️ AI Advisor unavailable (no API key or connection error).
Rule-based analysis: Review the benchmark data manually.
Key things to check:
- Frame times increasing >15% between resolutions = GPU bottleneck
- Stutter rate >5% = inconsistent frame pacing
- Smoothness ratio >2.0 = significant frame time spikes
- P1 FPS much lower than Avg FPS = periodic hitching
Set NVIDIA_API_KEY for AI-powered analysis.
